/**
 * Created by cry on 6/28/14.
 *
 * A BitCoin address is fundamentally derived from an elliptic curve public key and a set of network parameters.
 * It has several possible representations:<p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>The raw public key bytes themselves.
 * <li>RIPEMD160 hash of the public key bytes.
 * <li>A base58 encoded "human form" that includes a version and check code, to guard against typos.
 * </ol><p>
 *
 * One may question whether the base58 form is really an improvement over the hash160 form, given
 * they are both very unfriendly for typists. More useful representations might include qrcodes
 * and identicons.<p>
 *
 * Note that an address is specific to a network because the first byte is a discriminator value.
